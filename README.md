# Note Vault

**Note Vault** is an offline-first notes web application built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to work reliably even when the network is unstable or completely unavailable.

The project focuses on **data persistence, synchronization, and real-world frontend architecture**, going beyond a typical CRUD demo.

## Features

- **Offline-first architecture**  
  Create, edit, and delete notes without an internet connection.

- **Automatic synchronization**  
  Changes are synced seamlessly once the network is restored.

- **Reliable local persistence**  
  Notes are stored locally using browser storage (Cookies / LocalStorage).

- **Conflict-safe updates**  
  Prevents accidental data loss during sync.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**  
  Usable like a native app, but in browser.

- **Fast and responsive UI**  
  Built with modern React hooks and optimized rendering.

- **Scalable architecture**  
  Clean separation of UI and business logic for future growth.
